            <h1>Hi there, welcome to my introduction!</h1>
            <p>Hyacinthia has her own eclectic style and is very creatively skilled.
            <p>She really wants to learn how to
                create beautiful animated websites and is very eager to learn and evolve herself to get this done.</p>
            </p>
            <p>That's why she started an online course to become a Full Stack Web Developer in 2019 followed by the
                remote Web Development coding program from TechGrounds.

                This coding program is very intense but you will be able to work as a Junior Web Developer afterwards.
                In this course they will teach you how to work with:
                HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, SASS, Bootstrap, REACT and more.
            </p>
            <p> After six months you will be able to develop and improve your coding & soft skills true the community
                of
                TechGrounds & of course an employer who is willing to fine-tune your skills.

                Hyacintia has a history of working as a management assistent and administrative helpdesk specialist in
                all kinds of industries (software development, law, banking, real estate and more). She is strong in
                operation management and has graduated from Schoevers.</p>
